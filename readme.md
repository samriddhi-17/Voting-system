# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Title
Decentralized Voting System for Workshops

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a smart contract-based voting mechanism built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for transparent and tamper-proof voting processes, making it ideal for workshops and events that require secure and reliable voting. The contract enables the management of candidates, secure voting, and transparency in results.
